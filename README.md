# Testing FizzBuzz with Jest

Testing an implementation of the FizzBuzz function with Jest

### Objective

This is a challenged given to us on day 5 of the Futureproof Bootcamp (Auguste Cohort).
We were required to create a Fizzbuzz function and to test it with Jest.

### Tools

- nodeJS
- javascript
- jest
- npm

### Result

I was able to easily implement the function as I had seen it before.
I used a TDD approach:

- implemented the test functions
- let jest fail
- implement the function
- have the tests turn green

### RUN

```bash
node install
node test
```

### Thanks

My Teammate ( [Igor](https://github.com/igormirowski) ) and I decided to try to solve the exercise separately to challenge ourselves and to ask for help if required.
